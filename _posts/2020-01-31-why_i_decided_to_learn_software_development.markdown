I have been working in retail pharmacy for over 11 years, and for most of that time I had been completing pre-requisite classes part-time, while working full-time, in the hopes of one day aquiring my doctorate in pharmacy. I was preparing to apply for grad school this past fall when a coworker told me about coding bootcamps. The pharmacy field has taken a large downturn recently. Theres a saturation of new grads and not enough positions to guarantee full-time employment. Additionally, pay and benefits have decreased with lower market demand. Retail pharmacy is bleeding because of the increase of mail order meds, such as Amazon's purchase of pill pack, as well as, stiff competition and exclusionary pharmacy benefits companies. I knew that grad school was going to add no less than six figures of debt to my student loans, and I was no longer feeling as comfortable with my choices. All of these reasons helped further my disillusionment with the pharmacy field as a viable option for my future. 

I had always had an interest in the tech industry, and there were many times that I regretted not starting with that major right out of high school. I figured it was too late for a complete change in major having already spent so much time and money on pre-pharmacy. I felt sort of trapped. However, coding bootcamp seemed to offer a feasible career change option without the stress of starting all over. Software development offers a chance to be creative, as well as, a sense of completion when you finish a project. These are two things that really motivate me, and sadly they don't really exist in retail pharmacy.  I'm equal parts scared and excited to make a major life change. 

Thanks for reading!
