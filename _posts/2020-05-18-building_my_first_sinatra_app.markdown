This portfolio project was as interesting and it was infuriating at times. There were a few moments when I had no clue how I was going to finish this project. However, finally getting something to work was so thrilling that it constantly gave me the energy I needed to persist. I was also passionate about my idea for the app. It centered around live shows, which is my biggest past time/hobby. Being able to bring my idea to life was exilerating.

I think my biggest struggle involved getting the hang of Active Record. It's a very useful tool, but I also found it to be very rigid at times. Constantly having to migrate and rollback. I like the freedom of making quick changes to code and tables without the need to follow rigid procedure. There were times when I was unable to rollback changes because I had a typo somewhere, and the error messages seemed vague and cryptic. That being said, I was eventually able to get a better hold on it through research and trial and error. I definitely appreciate the benefits of Active Record.

On the flip side, Sinatra was fun to mess around with, and the built in error messages made it easy to backtrack and correct mistakes in code and routes. Overall, I'm happy with how my project turned out. I wanted to keep adding more aspects to the app, but I also wanted to submit my project on time. I think I'll be revisiting this project in the future to continue polishing it in my free time.
