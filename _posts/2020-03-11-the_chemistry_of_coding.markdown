Learning to code has definitely proved to be challenging, because a lot concepts are very abstract. Coding reminded me of learning abstract math concepts, as well as, organic chemistry. We're not only learning a new language, but we're also learning how this language works with itself. Coding is like a closed environment that ultimately produces something that we recognize in the real world. Likewise, in organic chemistry, you're learning a new language, while also using this new language to solve problems. 
Essentially, a chemistry student codes a reaction between organic molecules in order to create the desired product. One must predict how each molecule will react with one another, and in what order. Every step along the way is equally as important as the previous step. One wrong step will "break" the entire reaction. I call it the essence of math without the arithmetic. Luckily for me I enjoyed organic chemistry, even though it caused me great stress at times. However, it's a different kind of stress. Sometimes, I will want to pull my hair out, but the drive to see it work correctly and beat the problem is enough to keep going.
