I've finally finished our first portfolio project. I gotta say it definitely challenged my patience. I think that I finally had that juxtaposition of feelings where I felt helpless and had no clue how I was going to finish this in time; contrasted by that feeling of finally breaking through a problem that had caused me hours of grief.

One thing I definitely learned during this project is that I wasn't as comfortable with scraping as I thought I was. The tutorials definitely helped get me started and pointed in a direction, but sometimes I felt that I was doing exactly what was demonstrated, yet mine was breaking. After scouring the internet for hours, flipping through examples, and just entering any combination I could think of, I finally found the correct combination. 
I'm pretty happy with my final product. There's probably going to be some code refactoring and I'd like to add more features, but for now I'm happy that I was able to blast through the hurdles I faced using sheer determination. I'd also like to thank my girlfriend for ignoring my frustrated outburts.  : D

I'm ready for what's next!
