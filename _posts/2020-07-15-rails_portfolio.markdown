Writing my first ROR app proved to be as difficult as it was fun. In the early stages of the project I faced a ton of obstacles trying to get my many to many through relationships working properly. Previously, I had lamented about the awkward and, at times, rigid nature of Active Record. Much of this could be attributed to a learning curve as I felt more comfortable using it this time around. I was having trouble creating my object and then grabbing another object and connecting them properly through my join table. I spent the better part of two days researching and trying tons of different possible fixes to no resolve. The relationship problem had me stuck for a couple days, and I was finding it hard to imagine finishing the project within the appropriate timeframe. Turns out it was a simple "belongs to User" error in my table that through everything off. However, once I finally broke through it was relatively smooth sailing. There were plenty more speed bumps, but nothing that stopped my progress for too long. Now, the hard part for me is cleaning up the code. Getting things to work can be a messy venture. I try to code logically, but DRY code is entirely different story.

All things considered; I enjoyed this project. I plan on continuing to work on this app, and add more features/polish it up in my spare time after the assessments. I think this will be an ongoing project for a while.
